# SLOTS Simulation

This is a Simple Slots application created using GO.
- Go is a new language. 
- Although it borrows ideas from existing languages, it has unusual properties that make effective Go programs different in character from programs written in its relatives. 
- A straightforward translation of a C++ or Java program into Go is unlikely to produce a satisfactory result

$ go mod init # Create a go.mod file
```

This command is used to create a package of all the files in the repository.

```bash
